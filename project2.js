// Project 2
// Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers

// 1. Get two values from the user and store them as two numbers
// 2. Display what the numbers are on the HTML test-area
// 3. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the numbers
// 3. Display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers
//     -  For example, your HTML test-area should say something like:
//          "3 + 7 = 10"
//          "the sum of 3 and 7 is..."
