  /*
You will create a scoreboard that allows the user to add and remove points

1. You will need variables to store the points
2. When a user clicks on the add button, you will need to add to the variable, and then display it in HTML
3. When a user clicks the subtract button, you will need to subtract from the variable, and then display it in HTML
4. Use CSS Grids to build your scoreboard layout

CHALLENGE:
- Create a reset button that resets both scores
- Make it so your scoreboard cannot go below 0 points

GOOD LUCK ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
