Welcome to Dino's Looping Challenge of Doom!
You will need to create 4 loops for this challenge

1. Create a loop that writes "I love homework" 5 times
2. Create a loop that counts from 0 to 4 and writes the current number on the screen.
3. Create a loop that counts from 15 to 30 but only writes multiples of 3 on the screen
4. Create a loop that will draw 4X4 square using ⬜. ONLY PRINT 1 ⬜ at a time. Your loops should do the rest. It should look like this:
⬜⬜⬜⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜
document.write("⬜⬜⬜⬜") (X) <-- don't do this)
(HINT: Loops can be nested inside another loop)


CHALLENGE:
5. Dino is a very neat and organized dinosaur. He likes to stack the bones (🦴) of his victims in a nice pyramid shape. Create a stack that is 7 bones high.

      🦴
     🦴🦴
    🦴🦴🦴
   🦴🦴🦴🦴
  🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴 
 🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴
🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴🦴
