/* 
Create a shopping list web app

1. The user should be able to write an item for list
2. The item should be added to the list when the user pushes a button
3. You also need a delete button that removes the last item on the list
4. Your list should be displayed nicely and update each time the user pushes a button

CHALLENGE: 
- Create a feature that displays how many items are on the list
- Create a search feature that allows the user to check if an item is already added. The user should be notified if the item was found or not found.
    > Hint: You will need to use loops

GOOD LUCK ๐คนโโ๏ธ
