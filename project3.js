/*
You are trying to compare your BMI (Body Mass Index) with your friend's BMI.
BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meters).

1. Store you and your friend's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 

GOOD LUCK ‍💪
